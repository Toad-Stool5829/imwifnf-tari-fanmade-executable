# smg4-tari-mod-but-it-has-its-own-executable
based off of Kade Engine and Tari Mod V2



scuffed in places, but overall it works. i couldnt find out how to disable the update check so yeah live with it lol.

title tari doesnt exist because its not based off of the whitty mod.

if u want mac or linux version then suck it up and build it yourself im not ur slave.

also no 32bit cause i dont know how to do that, and 64 bit is better anyways. how does it feel not having windows 11? or not even having an up to date windows 10? must suck huh? just upgrade to 64bit then moron.
